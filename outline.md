# Intro to Programming in Python Outline

* Introduce ourselves: Co-founders of programming club, studying at McGill in Mechanical Engineering / Math and Computer Science.
* Ask how many people are coding for the first time, how many have more than 3 months of experience.
* Get two volunteers to come up. Get them to play tic tac toe against each other using the finished program we made.
* What is happening in this tic tac toe game underneath the hood? Ask people to form teams (of 3) to figure out the basic steps in the game. Then we ask a team to present, and we show a quick schematic of the programming architechture we came up with for the game.
* Start with printing the board
